# Introduction

Welcome to The Embedded (Rust) Introduction Book: An glance into "Bare Metal" embedded systems, such as Microcontrollers, coincidentally using the Rust
Programming Language.

## Who Embedded Introduction is For

Embedded Introduction is for everyone who wants to know a bit about the intricacies of embedded systems

## Scope

The goals of this book are:

* Get developers an introduction into the intricacies of embedded (Rust) development. i.e. What is GPIO and what are interrupts

This book tries to be as general as possible but to make things easier for both
the readers and the writers it uses the ARM Cortex-M architecture in all its
examples. However, the book doesn't assume that the reader is familiar with this
particular architecture and explains details particular to this architecture
where required.

## Who This Book is For

This book caters towards people with no embedded background and no Rust background.

### Assumptions and Prerequisites

* You are comfortable using a Programming Language.

### Other Resources

If you are unfamiliar with anything mentioned above or if you want more information about a specific topic mentioned in this book you might find some of these resources helpful.

## How to Use This Book

This book generally assumes that youâ€™re reading it front-to-back. Later
chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters may
not dig into details on a topic, revisiting the topic in a later chapter.

After a short introduction the book consists of exercises. These are basically fill in the dots exercises.
Each exercise chapter comes with its own project included in this repository

This book will be using the [Raspberry Pico] development board from
Raspberry.org for the exercises contained within. This board
is based on the ARM Cortex-M architecture, and while basic functionality is
the same across most CPUs based on this architecture, peripherals and other
implementation details of Microcontrollers are different between different
vendors, and often even different between Microcontroller families from the same
vendor.

For this reason, we suggest purchasing the [Raspberry Pico] development board
for the purpose of following the examples in this book.
